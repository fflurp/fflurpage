            Hi ‚Äî Nice to meet you!

          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            I‚Äôm Fflur Page, a freelance designer and illustrator based in Paris.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            After graduating from HETIC tech school, I worked 2 years as a
            Product Designer for a french startup. I was involved throughout the
            full design process from discovering users needs to delivering the
            best solution to address them. During that time, I got involved in
            product creative tasks, delivering illustrations and UI assets that
            would make the product stand out and meet the users‚Äô expectations.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            After that, I wanted to dedicated my work not only to interface
            design, but to product identity in it‚Äôs globality whether it might
            be UI design and assets, digital content creation or online
            branding. To me, all those things play a huge role in enhancing the
            users‚Äô experience while making a statement as a brand, and that‚Äôs
            precisely what I want to help product and marketing teams achieve.
